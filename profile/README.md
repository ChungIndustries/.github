<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project 🎯

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

**ChungIndustries** is an ambitious open-source project dedicated to recreating various parts of the internet infrastructure within Minecraft. Our vision is to build a fully functional digital ecosystem that mirrors real-world internet technologies, protocols, and services - all running inside the blocky world of Minecraft.

### Why This Project?

- **Educational Value**: Learn about internet protocols, networking, and distributed systems through hands-on Minecraft building
- **Technical Challenge**: Push the boundaries of what's possible with ComputerCraft and redstone engineering
- **Community Building**: Create a collaborative environment where developers and Minecraft enthusiasts can work together
- **Pure Coolness**: Because recreating the internet in Minecraft is just incredibly awesome! 😎

### Current Status

This project is currently in active development with several working components. While still very much a work-in-progress, we have foundational systems in place and are continuously expanding our capabilities.

<!-- KEY PROJECTS -->

## Key Projects 🚀

Our ecosystem consists of several interconnected projects:

### 🗺️ [ChungMaps](https://github.com/ChungIndustries/ChungMaps)

### 📦 [ChungPackageManager](https://github.com/ChungIndustries/ChungPackageManager)

**Package manager for Chung Packages** - The npm/pip equivalent for our ecosystem, making it easy to install and manage internet services.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->

## Contributing 🤝

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

### Ways to Contribute

- **Code**: Contribute to any of our repositories
- **Documentation**: Help improve READMEs and guides
- **Testing**: Test new features and report bugs
- **Ideas**: Suggest new internet components to recreate
- **Community**: Help others get started

### Development Workflow

To ensure a smooth workflow and maintain consistency across the repository, we have a few guidelines in place.

We follow a **main + development branch** workflow:

- **`main` branch**: Production-ready code that's thoroughly tested and reviewed
- **`development` branch**: Staging branch where feature branches are merged after review

#### Feature Branches

- Create a new feature branch for every new feature or bug fix
- Use descriptive names: `feature/user-authentication` or `bugfix/fix-login-error`

#### Pull Request Workflow

1. Ensure your feature branch is up to date with the `development` branch
2. Open a PR against the **`development` branch** for new features and bug fixes
3. Assign appropriate reviewers and provide clear descriptions
4. Once approved, your PR will be merged into `development`
5. Only tested and stable changes will be merged from `development` into `main`

#### Commit Message Format

We strictly adhere to the **Conventional Commits** convention. This helps maintain clear and consistent commit history while also allowing for automated release note generation. Please follow the guidelines outlined in [this guide](https://gist.github.com/Zekfad/f51cb06ac76e2457f11c80ed705c95a3).

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork one of our repositories and create a pull request.
