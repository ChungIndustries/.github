<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->

# Contribution Guide üöÄ

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our projects! Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. To ensure a smooth workflow and maintain consistency across the repository, we have a few guidelines in place.

## Branching Strategy üåø

We follow a **main + development branch** branch workflow:

- **`main` branch**: This is the production-ready branch. All changes here should be thoroughly tested and reviewed.
- **`development` branch**: This is the staging branch where feature branches are merged after review and testing.

### Feature Branches ‚ú®

- Create a new feature branch for every new feature or bug fix.
- Use a descriptive name for your branch, e.g., `feature/user-authentication` or `bugfix/fix-login-error`.

## Pull Request Workflow üîÑ

1. Ensure your feature branch is up to date with the `development` branch before opening a pull request (PR).
2. Open a PR against the **`development` branch** for new features and bug fixes.
3. Assign appropriate reviewers and provide a clear description of the changes made.
4. Once approved, your PR will be merged into the `development` branch.
5. Only tested and stable changes will be merged from `development` into `main`.

## Commit Message Format üìù

We strictly adhere to the **Conventional Commits** convention. This helps maintain clear and consistent commit history while also allowing for automated release note generation. Please follow the guidelines outlined in [this guide](https://gist.github.com/Zekfad/f51cb06ac76e2457f11c80ed705c95a3).

<!-- If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".
Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again! -->
